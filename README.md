# Samgo V2

[A bingo card for Sam](https://samgo.mikeware.com)! To use while watching any [Game Changer](https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer) episode. A layer deeper from [S6E5's "Bingo" episode](https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer/season:6/videos/bingo). Inspired by said episode, created in 2024 before the real Samgo arrived in 2025...

Above is the Samgo card featured in [S7E11's "Samalamadingdong" episode](https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer/season:7/videos/samalamadingdong) where the Bingo episode motif is used again. (Credit to `the_noah` on the `Dropout: Extra Credit` Discord for screen-capturing it.)

## Project Info

This was an educational endeavour to learn more about [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and CSS animations. It was built from the base Vue.js template but using [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

Hmmm, GitHub Pages workflow working, but assets not found... mystery for another day... Find [game here](https://samgo.mikeware.com).

Tested on PC with Edge and Firefox, Android Chrome, iPhone Brave and Safari browsers.

Original template instructions below.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

bun install

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
